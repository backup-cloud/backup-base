Feature: encrypt backup data using keys and information provided in SSM parameter store

In order provide secure backups of our data, paddle system engineering
team would like to have a system which takes public keys from S3,
based on a location given in SSM parameter store and uses that key to
upload and encrypted backup of our data to an S3 bucket.

    Background: we have prepared to run encrypted backups
    given I have access to an account for doing backups
      and I have a private public key pair
      and the public key from that key pair is stored in an s3 bucket

    Scenario: store encrypted backup in S3
    given that I have configured my settings in SSM
     and that I have a file in S3 to backup
     and that I have a backup context configured with matching users
    when I request a backup of that file using the context
    then a backup object should be created in the S3 destination bucket
     and if I decrypt that file the content with the private key it should match the original
    
    Scenario: store encrypted backup in S3 with incorrect s3_path
    given that I have configured my settings in SSM
     and that I have a file in S3 to backup
     and that I have a backup context configured with matching users with incorrect s3_path
    when I request a backup of that file using the context
    then a backup object should be created in the S3 destination bucket
     and if I decrypt that file the content with the private key it should match the original

    @future
    Scenario: automatically store encrypted backup in S3 based on SSM settings
    given that I have a set of folders in S3 containing some objects
     and that I have a file in my configuration directory with a list of those s3 folders
    when I run my backup script giving it the base path in SSM
    then backup objects should be created in the S3 destination bucket
     and if I decrypt any of those files the content with the private key it should match the original

    @future
    Scenario: store encrypted backup in S3 using a container
    given that I have configured a base path in SSM
     and that I have configured a public key and a reference to it
     and that I have an S3 backup bucket where I have write access
     and that I have a file in S3 to backup
    when I run my backup container giving the base path
    then a backup should be created in the S3 destination bucket
     and that backup should contain my data

    @future
    Scenario: store encrypted backup in S3 using an EC2 instance
    given that I have configured a base path in SSM
     and that I have configured a public key and a reference to it
     and that I have an S3 backup bucket where I have write access
     and that I have a file in S3 to backup
    when I run my backup container giving the base path
    then a backup should be created in the S3 destination bucket
     and that backup should contain my data
